#### Q. Why its free and opensource? ####
We believe accounting software market is a huge market. Few software products are dominating in this market. As a result, companies make standard products with fixed features. So customisation according to user needs is almost impossible or expensive. Not all business in the whole world is same, its business process, strategy, difference in delivery model and many other factors making each business different. Then how is it possible to use a single product with same facilities in all business in the world? We believe its impossible. Clients are sacrificing their requirements and its effecting their business. So we decided to develop a product which is people's choice. Clients will get ultimate power and they can decide what's their system. They can customise according to their needs. They can get support from anywhere instead of a single company. They can share the modified software with their friends. Its about the freedom, freedom to know.
#### Q. What's your benefit then? ####
1. Branding
2. CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility)
We are a company working in closed source products and services. We are working for clients all over the globe on their customised projects and services. Its the normal process of any software company and there was anything that much exciting. So we decided to do something exciting and something which will change the world. Something that will make impact all over the world. Something that will be beneficial for common people. Something will help to improve life of millions.
3. Revenue
#### Q. Is there any hidden cost? ####
Never, There is no hidden costs or tags within. It's absolutely free and open source.
#### Q. If it's free, who will support me? ####
If you use a preparatory software, its source code is closed and only the company can give you support. If you are not satisfied in support, there is no option for you. If the company closed down or denied to provide your software, data then your business will be in risk.
Here is the beauty of open source. As it's source code is open, even a computer student can support you. Any software companies / individual can download the source code for free of cost and can give you support. If you are not satisfied with a company, you can approach another one. So you don't need to beg for support to any company.
#### Q. I represent an organisation, I like your software, but need heavy customisation, who will do it. ? ####
You can hire one of our expert if it needs heavy customisation or development. Or you can approach any other company / individual who is providing customisation / development. As its source code is open, anyone can do it. Even your existing employee in your IT department may able to do it.
#### Q. Why its developed in Microsoft technologies? ####
Heh? Its not first time an open source project developed in Microsoft technologies. Mono, .netnuke, etc are successful open source projects developed in Microsoft technologies.
We are making complete source code, designs and everything available open to the world, that's the condition to be a project open source.
Most of our developers are working in Microsoft technologies and we are more comfortable on it. So we decided to do it in .net. We know that most of open source developers love to work in open source tools. Don't worry, a version of the same product is under development in python.
